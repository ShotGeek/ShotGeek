Dive deeper into a player's performance by exploring their stat trends in graphs directly from their profile page.

How to view a player's graph:

1. Navigate to any player's profile.
2. Scroll down to the **"Career Trends: Graph"** section.
3. Use the dropdown menu to choose a stat and career category (e.g. regular season, Points).
4. Watch the graph update to show season-by-season performance for the selected stat.
