ShotGeek allows you to easily switch between two player cards in a comparison. This feature is particularly useful for comparing players from different eras or positions.

**Steps to Search for a Player:**

To switch one of the two players in a comparison:

1. Use the search bar at the top of the player card.
2. Type the name of the new player and hit Enter.
3. Only one card (Player 1 or Player 2) can be changed at a time.
