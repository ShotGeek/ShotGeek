On ShotGeek, you can easily find a player's profile page using the search bar. This feature is designed to help you quickly access detailed stats and information about any current or former player in the NBA.


**Steps to Search for a Player:**

1. Enter the player's **full name** into the ShotGeek search bar.
2. Check for correct spelling — for example, use **Stephen Curry** rather than “Steph Curry.”
3. Hit Enter or click the search icon to view the player's profile page.

     <strong>Tip:</strong>While we work on an auto-suggest feature, please use Google to verify player spelling!
