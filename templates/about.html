                Ever been in a debate about an NBA player, only to get frustrated when the other person starts making up stats to support their argument? Or perhaps you enjoy diving deep into a player's shot profile, tendencies, and career trends? If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then you, my friend, are a ShotGeekâ€”welcome! We're happy to have you here!
