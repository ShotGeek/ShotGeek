# screenshot.yml
#
# This workflow captures visual snapshots of the ShotGeek homepage during pull
# requests. It boots the Django development server, uses a headless Chromium
# browser controlled by Puppeteer to grab screenshots, and uploads the images as
# build artifacts. This enables reviewers to assess layout changes without
# manually running the application.
#
# To keep the run fully deterministic and network-free, the job uses the
# SQLite database from the project's development settings and seeds it with a
# lightweight fixture (`nba_stats/fixtures/test_players.json`). This ensures the
# homepage renders with predictable data and avoids external API calls.
#
# The job provisions Python and Node.js using GitHub-hosted runners, avoiding
# any manual click-driven configuration. Artifacts are published through
# `actions/upload-artifact` so screenshots remain attached to the workflow run.
